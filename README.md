Welcome to the Toggle-Switch wiki!
# Toggle Switch description
It is a really easy and simple project that I found it interesting to play with some Animations. 
## The classes that the project contains
* ToggleSwitch (Superclass)
* IOSToggleSwitch (ToggleSwitch's subclass)
* GoogleToggleSwitch (ToggleSwitch's subclass)

***
## IOSToggleSwitch Class
 It is a Toggle button look like the one in IOS phones
 ## GoogleToggleSwitch Class
 It is a Toggle button look like the one in Google's history panel

***
These toggle buttons can be used by sticking a listener to it by using switchOnProperty and also can specify the fading colors when the switch is ON and OFF so it gives a good user experience, also everything in these classes is customizable, the colors, size of the background and the circle and you can make your own class by extending the ToggleSwitch class.
